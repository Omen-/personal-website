Hi there ! My name is Arthur Bellal, a Software Engineer curently located in Paris. I spend most of my free time building things or finding ways to break them apart. 



<!-- I am not a conventional 22 year old developer. From 14 years old I was always pasionate about programming. My first idols were not some famous musical band, but random devellopers distributing their work in obscure forums. I was amazed by the control they had over their environment. But their software were not enough, I had bigger ideas, I needed more. That's what got me into this and where began my adventure. 
Back then I had no skill but I was already highly motivated and very ressourcefull. To make my first ideas come true I needed to understand advanced topics like reverse-engineering, networking or graph theory. Obviously, at first I was not able to fully grasp thoses subjects, but after a lot of trial and error and google queries, my knownlege began to grow and I began to build things that were usefull for me. This made my first experiences about pursuing real-world objectives and I think it allowed me to thrive. -->
